        <p>My name is Krisztina Kovari. I used to work in television broadcasting for many years. I specialized in video-on-demand services and worked on the operational side of the business where I interacted closely with clients, engineers and other stakeholders. I was always attracted to the technical aspects of my job and as a supervisor, problem solving was a big part of my daily tasks. </p>
        <p> I started coding as a hobby in 2016 by following a course on udemy and I continued coding on and off since. In 2018 November, I finished a 9-week-long coding bootcamp at Le Wagon and since then I am engaged full-time with web development by building applications and learning new skills. I really enjoy working in Rails, which enables me to create complete applications.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I play the bass guitar in a punkrock band called MAYBE NOT, I run and do yoga and take photographs on my hikes.</p>
